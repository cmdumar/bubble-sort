# Bubble Sort
> Implementation of Bubble Sort Algorithm using Ruby

## This project is based on the Bubble Sort Algorithm
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

## Features

* Sort integers using Bubble Sort Algorithm
* Sort strings according to their length

## Built with

1. Ruby
2. Rubocop (Linter)
